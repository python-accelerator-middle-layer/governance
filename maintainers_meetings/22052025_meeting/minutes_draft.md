## Work packages

Common agreement that current work packages should focus
on work to be executed in the following month. Thus understanding
to focus on the demonstration use cases as discussed in work-shop
at HZB (tune ctl, orbit feedback, post meeting comment).

Therefore, two main packages were drafted.

* core: consisting of
        control system abstraction,
        (mathematical libraries),
        analysis

* testing:
     test the code run it against either twins or real world machine,
     share their experience on using the code

It was dedicded to use only pyAT as tracking engine for the demonstrator.
On the long run different back engines should be useble.

Proposal were made to look into offering dedicated training
for colleagues that are interesting to improve
their general python training skills.


## Role nominations

* Coordinator: Waheedullah Sulaiman Khail
* Secretary: Pierre Schnizer
* Work package coorinators
  * Core: Jean-Luc Pons
