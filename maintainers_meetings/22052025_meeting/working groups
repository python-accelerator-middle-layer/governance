## ðŸ§© Initial Working Group Suggestions

Please feel free to add your suggestions below or propose changes via email.

### 1. Analysis
- High-level analysis for applications such as BBA (Beam-Based Alignment) and LOCO (Linear Optics from Closed Orbits)
- Development of analysis applications (e.g., LOCO, BBA, etc.)

### 2. Measurement
- Simulated commissioning setups
- Execution of measurements in real or test environments

### 3. Mathematical Libraries
- Development and maintenance of shared mathematical libraries used in analysis and measurement

### 4. Architecture
- System architecture and dependency separation (e.g., ensuring clear separation and modularity based on control system requirements)

### 5. Testing
- Testing of developed components at your own facilities
- Collecting user feedback (e.g., usability, setup challenges, execution experience)

### 6. CI/CD & Integration
- Setting up and maintaining continuous integration / continuous deployment pipelines
- Ensuring automated testing and deployment practices are in place
