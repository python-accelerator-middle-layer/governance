    Descriptions of Roles
    -- Let’s go through and define each role clearly to ensure responsibilities and expectations are well understood.
    Descriptions of Working Groups
    -- We should also write up a brief and clear description for each working group.
    Renaming the Testing Working Group
    -- The Steering Committee has requested a more descriptive name for the Testing Working Group.
    Code Week Proposal
    -- My suggestion would be to first check our schedules and find a date that works for the four of us, along with anyone else we consider essential to have there. Once we’ve agreed on a date, we can announce it to the maintainers—especially those involved in the core working package.
    Everyone will be welcome to join, but participation will not be mandatory. This is just my proposal—I’d be happy to hear your thoughts.
