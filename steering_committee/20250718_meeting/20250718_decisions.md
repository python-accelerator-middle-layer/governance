**1. Maintainer Conflict and Project Management:**

- Laurent to discuss with Vadim to call the Coordinators Meetings and moderate them until the workshop. If he does not agree, someone else from
the Steering Committee has to do it.

- Unclear processes and topics are to be solved within this meeting based on the available documents. The Coordinators should make sure that the
implementations are compliant with the specifications in the documents and include expertise from their labs.

- The master branch should be defined with a clear deadline and tasks.
