**1. Approve minutes from last meeting**  
- Approved with no notes

**2. Election of maintainer: Marco Apollonio**   
- Approved with no notes 
	
**3. Report from maintainers (Teresia):**   
- The roles and responsibilites of the positions Coordinator, WG Core, WG Testing and Secretary has not been fully agreed on.
- Markus Ries will support the group in mapping out the organizational structure during the setup phase.
- The action list that was agreed upon in the last meeting of the group still needs to be delivered. Teresia will remind them. 
	

**4. Relation between pyAML and Accelerator Toolbox (Simone):**  
- There are features in pyAT that might be needed in the core.
- It was decided that:
	- It is okay that pyAT become a requirement for pyAML.
	- Inititally no abstraction of the simulation engine should be done and only pyAT should be used.
	- The abstraction can be added at a later point. Then it is important to consider that people might not have a pyAT lattice so features cannot rely on that.
	
	
**5. Approval process for specification (Teresia):**
- Process for approving the specification documents. It was decided that:
	- Documents should evolve with the code during the prototype process as "living documents".
	- The latest state should be sent out for feedback to the community before the next workshop. At the workshop it will be presented as a core information source going forwards together with milestones. 
	- An FAQ on the webpage can be used to link to the documents and get more people to read them.
		
	
**6. Next workshop at SOLEIL (Laurent & Teresia):**
It was decided that Laurent will talk to Vadim and put together a proposal. Things to consider are:
- Date: Feb 2026. Save the Date should be sent as fast as possible.
- Timeframe - 2 or 3 days, potentially part of the last day could be training for those who are interested as on the AT workshop at ESRF.
- Content:  
	- Status of the prototype
	- Status of the specification documents  
	- Hackathon
	- In-person meeting of the steering committee
	- Training? (see next point in the minutes)  
- Options for hybrid participation - Zoom with breakout rooms or Zoom events? This depends on what the content should be.
- Funding - We got no funding from COST. Previously we got funding from LEAPS but the administration was not completely easy. Other option to consider is participation fees.
- A scientific committe should be set up before the meeting - this can be the steering committee if it makes the administration easier.
 

**7. Training (Teresia):**
At the last workshop a preliminary list of required training was put together. How do we proceed with this?   
- Control System: Teresia to arrange it for the next community zoom meeting.
- pyAT: online training? - Simone to prepare it for the afternoon last day of the workshop in a hybrid format, for our people and interested external people.  
	
	
**8. Date for next community zoom meeting (Teresia):**  
Suggested date: Thursday 4 September 2025   
- No objections  
	
**9. Next meeting time:**  
Next meeting is planned to 18 July 2025 11.00-12.00 CEST.   
- No objections
