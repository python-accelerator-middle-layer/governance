Approve minutes from last meeting
	-  approved with no notes 

Election of maintainer: Marco Apollonio
	• approved with no notes 
	
Report from maintainers (Teresia):
	• The roles and responsibilites of the positions Coordinator, WG Core, WG Testing and Secretary has not been fully agreed on. Markus Ries will support the group in mapping out the organizational structure during the setup phase. 
	• The action list that was agreed upon in the last meeting of the group still needs to be delivered. Teresia will remind them. 
	

Relation between pyAML and Accelerator Toolbox (Simone):
	- Jean-Luc says there are features in pyAT that might be needed in the core and wants input on if the core should be allowed to import accelerator toolbox or 
It was decided that:
	- It is agreed that pyAT will become a requirement for pyAML.
	- Inititally, no abstraction of the simulation engine should be done. Only pyAT should be used. 
	- The abstraction can be added at a later point. It is important to consider that people should not need a pyAT lattice for the abstraction. 
	
	
Approval process for specification (Teresia):
- Pocess for approving the specification documents. 
	- document should evolve with the code according to needs as a "living document"
	- Latest state should be sent out for feedback before the next workshop, where it will be presented within the milestone and as a core information source going forwards. 
	- An FAQ on the Git-Webpage can link to the documents
		
	
Next workshop at SOLEIL (Laurent will talk to Vadim and make a proposal):
		○ Dates - Feb 2026. Save the Date should be sent as fast as possible
		○ Timeframe - 2 work days of program into 3 days, or different format? 
		○ Content:
			§ Present use case, 
			§ Prototype
			§ Status of the documents, 
			§ Working groups for hackathon. 
			§ In-person meeting of the steering committee. 
		○ Options for hybrid participation - Zoom with breaktout rooms? 
		○ Funding - no COST funding this time. Funding from LEAPS or participation fees might be considered,
		○ Scientific Committe should be set up before the meeting - should it be the Steering Committee?

At the last workshop a preliminary list of required training was put together. How do we proceed with this?
