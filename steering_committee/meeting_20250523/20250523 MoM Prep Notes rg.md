#### Agenda:
1. Approve minutes from last meeting
2. Support letter for accMeta
    HZB and KIT are applying to the Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration Call. The project concerns developing a common metadata standard for accelerators, towards a future ontology. No funding or resources are required from pyAML but they are asking for a support letter for the application. Deadline is 30 May 2025.
3. Report from maintainers meeting
4. Working groups and working group leaders
5. Appointment of maintainers
    According to the governance document we need to officially appoint the maintainers. For list of people to elect, see maintainers_to_elect.md
6. Roles on Github
    Maybe we need to go through the list of the current members and modify roles so not everyone has full permissions to all repositories anymore but only to the parts that they should be allowed to modify based on their role according to the governance document?
    Suggestions for github roles, see github_roles.md
7.  pyAML license
8. Specification documents
9.Level of bluesky integration
