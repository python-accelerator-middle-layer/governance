Suggestions for github roles:

1. Only members of the steering committee should be owner of the organisation
2. For the existing repositories for exploratory projects the contributors to those projects should be made admin for the repository
3. A team should be created for the pyAML maintainers and this team should have admin permissions to the pyAML repositories.
