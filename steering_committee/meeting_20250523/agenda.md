Agenda:

- Report from maintainers meeting

- Working groups and working group leaders

- Appointment of maintainers: according to the governance document we need to officially appoint the maintainers

- Specification documents

- Roles on Github: maybe we need to go through the list of the current members and modify roles so not everyone has full permissions to all repositories anymore but only to the parts that they should be allowed to modify based on their role according to the governance document?
