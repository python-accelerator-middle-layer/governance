#### Support Letter for accMeta  
HZB and KIT are applying to the Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration Call. The project concerns developing a common metadata standard for accelerators, towards a future ontology. No funding or resources are required from pyAML but they are asking for a support letter for the application. Deadline is 30 May 2025.  
- ![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3216011-a86b-4444-8c07-427f583c5eff)  
- HZB can provide templates for Support Letter. Teresia will do this and send it out.   
- It is not needed to commit to ressources.  
- Timeline for ESRF is not possible, but it can be done by pyAML steering board.  
- Is it OK that pyAML is not an official entity - this is not an issue with the projekt when the letter comes from the steering board.  
***- Teresia will send out the template for the support letter to be signed before May 30, 2025***

Questions and Discussion:   

- Definition of the three roles still TBD, tasks of coordinator unclear:  
- ***->  A short description of the roles should be provided by the proposed people. Steering committee will review them.***  
   
- Time commitment:   
- ***-> Proposed people and people on the maintainers list are ready to commit time to the roles. A fast feedback loop between core team and testing team is needed.***  

- Definition of the groups and WPs:   
- **-> More specific name for "Testing" work group is needed.***    
- ***-> A specified timeline for the exploration phase and prototype phase to Feb 2026 should be  set.***    
- ***-> After this deadline, new working groups should be defined.***     
- ***-> List of Deliverables and WP (description in 2 sentences each) contents should be generated.***
- 4 elected people

#### Appointment of Maintainers  
[maintainers_to_elect.md](maintainers_to_elect.md)  
***List approved with no notes.***   

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### Roles on Github  
Maybe we need to go through the list of the current members and modify roles so not everyone has full permissions to all repositories anymore but only to the parts that they should be allowed to modify based on their role according to the governance document?

Suggestions for github roles: [github_roles.md](github_roles.md)

1. Only members of the steering committee should be owner of the organisation.  
2. For the existing repositories for exploratory projects the contributors to those projects should be made admin for the repository.  
3. A team should be created for the pyAML maintainers and this team should have admin permissions to the pyAML repositories.  

- Keep it simple.  
- Use "team" functionality to manage the repositories.  
- ***-> Older Repositories should be cleaned up / moved, so the current setup can be used for the official pyAML organizaion. Project participants will be informed by Teresia and roles will be assigned.***   
  
&nbsp;
&nbsp;


#### pyAML License  
- Only one feedback concerning the scientific library.  
-  ***-> The proposal from the last meeting, Apache 2.0, was accepted.***

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### Specification Documents  
- Currently not many labs involved in the specification process.  
- Everyone has been invited to contribute, open questions have been answered.
- ***-> Draft version of the document should be available by end of May***
- ***-> Approval process by end of the year needed.***  

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### Level of bluesky integration  
- Background information and opinions have been exchanged via E-Mail   
- Suggestion: to be explored during the current project phase. Collaboration opportunities on the beamline side should be explored at the same time.  
- Maintainers should be able to explore the benefit.
- Users should be able to plug in / import their prefered (standard) applications.
- ***-> Discussion postponed. Teresia to prepare a summary of needed functions.*** 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### Next meeting time: 20 June 2025 11.00-12.00 CEST.
- ***->27. June 2025 is better***

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### Approve minutes from this meeting
- ***Internal Minutes Draft will be kept within Teresias folder***
