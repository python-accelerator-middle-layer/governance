#### Approve Minutes from last meeting

#### Support Letter for accMeta
HZB and KIT are applying to the Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration Call. The project concerns developing a common metadata standard for accelerators, towards a future ontology. No funding or resources are required from pyAML but they are asking for a support letter for the application. Deadline is 30 May 2025.

- HZB can provide templates for Support Letter. Teresia will do this and send it out. 
- It is not needed to commit to ressources.
- Timeline for ESRF is not possible, but it can be done by pyAML steering board
- Is it OK that pyAML is not an official entity - this is not an issue with the projekt when the letter comes from the steering board.
***- Teresia will send out the template for the support letter to be signed before May 30, 2025***

Questions and Diskussion:   

- Definition of the three roles still TBD, tasks of coordinator unclear:  
- ***->  A short description of the roles should be provided by the proposed people. Steering committee will review them.***
   
- Time commitment:   
- ***-> Proposed people and people on the maintainers list are ready to commit time to the roles. A fast feedback loop between core team and testing team is needed.***

- Definition of the groups and WPs:  
- **-> More specific name for "Testing" work group is needed.***  
- ***-> A specified timeline for the exploation phase and prototype phase to Feb 2026 should be   - set.***  
- ***-> After this deadline, new working groups should be defined.***  
- ***-> List of responsible people should be delivered to commitee.***  
- ***-> List of Deliverables and WP contents should be generated.***  
 


#### Working groups and working group leaders

#### Appointment of maintainers
[maintainers_to_elect.md](maintainers_to_elect.md)
***List approved with no notes.*** 

#### Roles on Github
Maybe we need to go through the list of the current members and modify roles so not everyone has full permissions to all repositories anymore but only to the parts that they should be allowed to modify based on their role according to the governance document?

Suggestions for github roles: [github_roles.md](github_roles.md)

1. Only members of the steering committee should be owner of the organisation
2. For the existing repositories for exploratory projects the contributors to those projects should be made admin for the repository
3. A team should be created for the pyAML maintainers and this team should have admin permissions to the pyAML repositories.
