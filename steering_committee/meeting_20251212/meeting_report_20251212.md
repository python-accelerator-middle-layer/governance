**Report from steering committee meeting 12 December 2025**

1. **Status of the training survey results**  
There has been 11 answers so far. 8 people were interested in training.  
For the workshop the training should focus on preparing for the hackathon.  
A development documentation will be started to help people set up a development environment.

2. **Updates about the workshop**  
Registration has opened. There will be a registration fee of 100 Euro.  
We are still waiting for information about financing from LEAPS.  
Remote participation is needed for colleagues who can't travel. This will be figured out. The people interested in remote participation should contact Vadim.
It was suggested that registration fee for remote participants should be half of the fee for in-person participants.  
The agenda and plans for the hackathon were discussed.

3. **Plans for new working groups and election of coordinators**  
We previously decided on working groups and coordinators for the propotype phase. This phase ends at the workshop so we need to decide what to do next.  
It was decided to discuss this during the final session of the workshop and then follow it up at the following steering committee meeting.

4. **Date for next community meeting**  
Next community meeting will be 5 March 16.00-18.00 (CET).

5. **Next meeting time**  
Next meeting is 4 February in-person at SOLEIL after the workshop.
